Hello! I'm Michael Berk. I'm currently a student studying Computer Science, but in my spare time, I work on a number of different side-projects. I've made an app for keeping track of Speedruns, and apps for the Jewish Prayer Book and prayer times. During the Summer of 2022, I had the wonderful oppertunity to be an intern on the Messages team at Apple. 

I've created the blog on this website as a way to share various interesting things I've learned between school, work, and my side-projects.
